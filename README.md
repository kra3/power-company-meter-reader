# springboot_sampler
Spring boot - CRUD - JPA - experiment


Available CRUD endpoints are: 

    - http://localhost:8080/api/meterReadings
    - http://localhost:8080/api/profiles


They are HATEOS ready, hence will act as self documentation. 
Appending `/search` to the endpoints will reveal available custom functions.


# How to run

`mvn spring-boot:run` will launch the application at http://localhost:8080/api/
